# aunthenticated_user_dashboard

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project successfully implements a secure Flutter authentication system integrated with a modern, responsive dashboard using Firebase Auth. Today's development focused on 
enhancing code stability and UI polish by migrating deprecated .withOpacity() methods to the current .withValues(alpha: ...) standard and resolving BoxBorder type mismatches 
using Border.all for container decorations. Furthermore, robust null safety was established in the account details section using ternary logic to prevent crashes during 
asynchronous Firebase state changes, resulting in an error-free "Problems" tab and a production-ready user experience.
